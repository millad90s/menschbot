### requirement 
you just need to have a file called '.env' and define a variable as below equal to your telegrap api key
TELEGRAM_API_KEY='Telgram_api_key'

### Todo 
* If there is no news yet, then we can send news from yesterday, however as we dont know when exactly then news publish we should avoid calling api by every request from users. 

* Audio / Podcast / Conversation 
* Reminder
* FlashCart
* notebook ML
* Having Them and Category 
* free version and using Advertisements 
* IELTSE Writing feature
* 1:1 or group Call / anonymouse 

## Solution:
* probably we can use schdeluer every 1 hour call the api , if user requested new news.


## Notes
FlashCarts Are Boring
Listen to the audio files while walking or moving ....
